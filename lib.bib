  Abstract                 = {We introduce DeLeNoX (Deep Learning Novelty Explorer), a system that autonomously creates artifacts in constrained spaces according to its own evolving interestingness criterion. DeLeNoX proceeds in alternating phases of exploration and transformation. In the exploration phases, a version of novelty search augmented with constraint handling searches for maximally diverse artifacts using a given distance function. In the transformation phases, a deep learning autoencoder learns to compress the variation between the found artifacts into a lower-dimensional space. The newly trained encoder is then used as the basis for a new distance function, transforming the criteria for the next exploration phase. In the current paper, we apply DeLeNoX to the creation of spaceships suitable for use in two-dimensional arcade-style computer games, a representative problem in procedural content generation in games. We also situate DeLeNoX in relation to the distinction between exploratory and transformational creativity, and in relation to Schmidhuber’s theory of creativity through the drive for compression progress.},

  Abstract                 = {This report documents Dagstuhl Seminar 15051 "Artificial and Computational Intelligence in Games: Integration". The focus of the seminar was on the computational techniques used to create, enhance, and improve the experiences of humans interacting with and within virtual environments. Different researchers in this field have different goals, including developing and testing new AI methods, creating interesting and believable non-player characters, improving the game production pipeline, studying game design through computational means, and understanding players and patterns of interaction. In recent years it has become increasingly clear that many of the research goals in the field require a multidisciplinary approach, or at least a combination of techniques that, in the past, were considered separate research topics. The goal of the seminar was to explicitly take the first steps along this path of integration, and investigate which topics and techniques would benefit most from collaboration, how collaboration could be shaped, and which new research questions may potentially be answered.},

  Abstract                 = {The focus of this survey is on research in applying evolutionary and other metaheuristic search algorithms to automatically generating content for games, both digital and nondigital (such as board games). The term search-based procedural content generation is proposed as the name for this emerging field, which at present is growing quickly. A taxonomy for procedural content generation is devised, centering on what kind of content is generated, how the content is represented and how the quality/fitness of the content is evaluated; search-based procedural content generation in particular is situated within this taxonomy. This article also contains a survey of all published papers known to the authors in which game content is generated through search or optimisation, and ends with an overview of important open research problems.},
