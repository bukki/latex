	plasma tryptophan to the sum of the other large neutral amino acids

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:
	
	Cognitive performance often declines under chronic stress exposure.
	The negative effect of chronic stress on performance may be mediated
	by reduced brain serotonin function. The uptake of the serotonin
	precursor tryptophan into the brain depends on nutrients that influence
	the availability of tryptophan by changing the ratio of plasma tryptophan
	to the sum of the other large neutral amino acids (Trp-LNAA ratio).
	In addition, a diet-induced increase in tryptophan may increase brain
	serotonergic activity levels and improve cognitive performance, particularly
	in high stress-vulnerable subjects.
	
	
	OBJECTIVE:
	
	We tested whether alpha-lactalbumin, a whey protein with a high tryptophan
	content, would increase the plasma Trp-LNAA ratio and improve cognitive
	performance in high stress- vulnerable subjects.
	
	
	DESIGN:
	
	Twenty-three high stress-vulnerable subjects and 29 low stress-vulnerable
	subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover
	study. All subjects conducted a memory-scanning task after the intake
	of a diet enriched with either alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-lactalbumin
	diet) or sodium caseinate (control diet). Blood samples were taken
	to measure the effect of dietary manipulation on the plasma Trp-LNAA
	ratio.
	
	
	RESULTS:
	
	A significantly greater increase in the plasma Trp-LNAA ratio after
	consumption of the alpha-lactalbumin diet than after the control
	diet (P = 0.0001) was observed; memory scanning improved significantly
	only in the high stress-vulnerable subjects (P = 0.019).
	
	
	CONCLUSION:
	
	Because an increase in the plasma Trp-LNAA ratio is considered to
	be an indirect indication of increased brain serotonin function,
	the results suggest that dietary protein rich in alpha-lactalbumin
	improves cognitive performance in stress-vulnerable subjects via
	increased brain tryptophan and serotonin activities.},
