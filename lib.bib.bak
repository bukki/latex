  abstract = {We introduce DeLeNoX (Deep Learning Novelty Explorer), a system that
	autonomously creates artifacts in
	
	constrained spaces according to its own evolving interestingness criterion.
	DeLeNoX proceeds in alternating
	
	phases of exploration and transformation. In the exploration phases,
	a version of novelty search augmented
	
	with constraint handling searches for maximally diverse
	
	artifacts using a given distance function. In the transformation phases,
	a deep learning autoencoder learns to
	
	compress the variation between the found artifacts into
	
	a lower-dimensional space. The newly trained encoder
	
	is then used as the basis for a new distance function,
	
	transforming the criteria for the next exploration phase.
	
	In the current paper, we apply DeLeNoX to the creation of spaceships
	suitable for use in two-dimensional
	
	arcade-style computer games, a representative problem
	
	in procedural content generation in games. We also situate DeLeNoX
	in relation to the distinction between exploratory and transformational
	creativity, and in relation
	
	to Schmidhuber’s theory of creativity through the drive
	
	for compression progress.},

	other metaheuristic search algorithms to automatically generating
	content for games, both digital and nondigital (such as board games).
	The term search-based procedural content generation is proposed as
	the name for this emerging field, which at present is growing quickly.
	A taxonomy for procedural content generation is devised, centering
	on what kind of content is generated, how the content is represented
	and how the quality/fitness of the content is evaluated; search-based
	procedural content generation in particular is situated within this
	taxonomy. This article also contains a survey of all published papers
	known to the authors in which game content is generated through search
	or optimisation, and ends with an overview of important open research
	problems.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce DeLeNoX (Deep Learning Novelty Explorer), a system that autonomously creates artifacts in
constrained spaces according to its own evolving interestingness criterion. DeLeNoX proceeds in alternating
phases of exploration and transformation. In the exploration phases, a version of novelty search augmented
with constraint handling searches for maximally diverse
artifacts using a given distance function. In the transformation phases, a deep learning autoencoder learns to
compress the variation between the found artifacts into
a lower-dimensional space. The newly trained encoder
is then used as the basis for a new distance function,
transforming the criteria for the next exploration phase.
In the current paper, we apply DeLeNoX to the creation of spaceships suitable for use in two-dimensional
arcade-style computer games, a representative problem
in procedural content generation in games. We also situate DeLeNoX in relation to the distinction between exploratory and transformational creativity, and in relation
to Schmidhuber’s theory of creativity through the drive
for compression progress.},

  Abstract                 = {The focus of this survey is on research in applying evolutionary and other metaheuristic search algorithms to automatically generating content for games, both digital and nondigital (such as board games). The term search-based procedural content generation is proposed as the name for this emerging field, which at present is growing quickly. A taxonomy for procedural content generation is devised, centering on what kind of content is generated, how the content is represented and how the quality/fitness of the content is evaluated; search-based procedural content generation in particular is situated within this taxonomy. This article also contains a survey of all published papers known to the authors in which game content is generated through search or optimisation, and ends with an overview of important open research problems.},
