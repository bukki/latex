  abstract = {We introduce DeLeNoX (Deep Learning Novelty Explorer), a system that
	autonomously creates artifacts in constrained spaces according to
	its own evolving interestingness criterion. DeLeNoX proceeds in alternating
	phases of exploration and transformation. In the exploration phases,
	a version of novelty search augmented with constraint handling searches
	for maximally diverse artifacts using a given distance function.
	In the transformation phases, a deep learning autoencoder learns
	to compress the variation between the found artifacts into a lower-dimensional
	space. The newly trained encoder is then used as the basis for a
	new distance function, transforming the criteria for the next exploration
	phase. In the current paper, we apply DeLeNoX to the creation of
	spaceships suitable for use in two-dimensional arcade-style computer
	games, a representative problem in procedural content generation
	in games. We also situate DeLeNoX in relation to the distinction
	between exploratory and transformational creativity, and in relation
	to Schmidhuber’s theory of creativity through the drive for compression

	other metaheuristic search algorithms to automatically generating
	content for games, both digital and nondigital (such as board games).
	The term search-based procedural content generation is proposed as
	the name for this emerging field, which at present is growing quickly.
	A taxonomy for procedural content generation is devised, centering
	on what kind of content is generated, how the content is represented
	and how the quality/fitness of the content is evaluated; search-based
	procedural content generation in particular is situated within this
	taxonomy. This article also contains a survey of all published papers
	known to the authors in which game content is generated through search
	or optimisation, and ends with an overview of important open research
	problems.},
